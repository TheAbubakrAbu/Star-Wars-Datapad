# Star Wars Datapad

The **Star Wars Datapad** app is an interactive web application built with JavaScript on Code.org. This project was inspired by **Star Wars** and was developed to simulate a fully functional datapad, complete with **Aurebesh translation**, **dynamic themes**, and interactive features. It combines creativity and technical skills to deliver an engaging experience for Star Wars fans.

## About the Project

This app brings the Star Wars universe to life by providing a versatile datapad experience. Users can explore Aurebesh, the iconic writing system from Star Wars, translate between Aurebesh and English, and customize their experience with dynamic themes inspired by different Star Wars factions. It serves as both a functional utility and a fun, immersive tool for Star Wars enthusiasts. It inspired me to create **Datapad | Aurebesh Translator** on the Apple App Store today.

### Key Features:

1. **Aurebesh Translation:**
   - Translate between **Aurebesh** and **English** in both directions.
   - Supports single letters, digraphs, and punctuation marks.
   - Provides visual representation of each Aurebesh symbol during translation.

2. **Dynamic Themes:**
   - Customize the app’s look and feel with themes inspired by iconic Star Wars factions, including:
     - Jedi
     - Sith
     - Mandalorian
     - Rebel Alliance
     - Galactic Empire
     - Bounty Hunter
     - Pirate
   - Themes change the app’s colors, images, and sounds for an immersive experience.

3. **Interactive Features:**
   - **Search Functionality:** Look up Aurebesh letters by name or pronunciation.
   - **Random Letter Selection:** Discover a random Aurebesh letter and learn its pronunciation.
   - **Pronunciation Playback:** Hear the proper pronunciation of Aurebesh letters.

4. **Educational Mode:**
   - Toggle between showing English and Aurebesh letters for learning.
   - Explore the full Aurebesh alphabet with visual and auditory aids.

5. **Responsive Navigation:**
   - Easy-to-use navigation buttons for quick access to the translator, alphabet, search, and information sections.
